# Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction-
Project Summary: Sonar Rock vs. Mine Classification
Objective:

The project aims to build a machine learning model to classify sonar signals as either a "Rock" (R) or a "Mine" (M) using logistic regression, based on a dataset of sonar signal features.

Dataset:

The dataset, loaded from a CSV file (sonar data.csv), contains 208 rows and 61 columns.
Each row represents a sonar signal with 60 numerical features (likely signal intensities or frequencies) and 1 label column (60th column) indicating "R" (Rock) or "M" (Mine).
The dataset is balanced, with features summarized by mean, standard deviation, and other statistics, showing variability across the 60 features.
Methodology:

Data Preprocessing:
The dataset is loaded using pandas without headers, and the 60th column is used as the target variable (y), while the remaining 60 columns are features (x).
The data is split into training (90%, 187 samples) and testing (10%, 21 samples) sets using train_test_split with stratification to maintain the proportion of "R" and "M" labels. The random_state=1 ensures reproducibility.
Model Training:
A logistic regression model from scikit-learn is trained on the training data (x_train, y_train).
Logistic regression is chosen for its suitability for binary classification tasks.
Model Evaluation:
Training Accuracy: The model achieves an accuracy of approximately 83.42% on the training data, indicating good learning on the training set.
Test Accuracy: The model achieves an accuracy of approximately 76.19% on the test data, suggesting decent generalization to unseen data.
The difference between training and test accuracy indicates slight overfitting, but the model still performs reasonably well.
Prediction System:
A predictive system is implemented to classify new sonar data.
An example input with 60 features is provided, reshaped into a NumPy array for prediction.
The model predicts the class ("R" or "M") for the input, and a simple conditional statement outputs whether the object is a "Rock" or a "Mine." In the example, the prediction is "M" (Mine).
Key Libraries Used:

pandas: For data loading and manipulation.
numpy: For array operations.
matplotlib.pyplot: Imported but not used in the provided code.
scikit-learn: For model training (LogisticRegression), data splitting (train_test_split), and evaluation (accuracy_score).
Results:

The logistic regression model successfully classifies sonar signals with reasonable accuracy.
The training accuracy (83.42%) and test accuracy (76.19%) indicate that the model is effective but could potentially benefit from further optimization (e.g., feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, or trying other algorithms).
The predictive system demonstrates practical application by classifying a new input as a "Mine."
Potential Improvements:

Explore feature engineering or dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) to handle the high number of features (60).
Test other classification algorithms (e.g., SVM, Random Forest) for potentially better performance.
Perform hyperparameter tuning for logistic regression (e.g., adjusting regularization strength).
Include cross-validation to ensure robust evaluation.
